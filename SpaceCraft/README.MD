# Spacecraft Simulation Project

## Overview
This project simulates various systems within a spacecraft, providing a modular object-oriented design in C++. The simulation includes components such as propulsion, navigation, communication, and life support systems.

## Features
- Modular design with base and derived classes for easy expansion
- Simulated activation and deactivation of spacecraft systems
- Status reporting for individual components

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- C++ compiler (GCC recommended)
- Make (optional for build automation)

### Compilation
To compile the project, use the following command in the project's root directory:
