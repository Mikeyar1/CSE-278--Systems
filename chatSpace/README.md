# C++ Chat Space application

This project is a simple version chat application implemented in C++, 
allowing multiple clients to connect to a server and communicate with each other in real time. 
The application uses socket programming for network communication and multithreading to handle multiple clients simultaneously.

## Features

- **Multi-client support:** Multiple clients can connect to the server and send messages to all other connected clients.
- **Color-coded messages:** Messages are color-coded in the terminal for better readability.
- **Customizable usernames:** Users can set their names upon joining the chat.
- **Graceful exit:** Users can leave the chat session gracefully, and a notification is broadcasted to all other users.
